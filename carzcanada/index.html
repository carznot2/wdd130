                <h3>Our Search Service is Free!</h3>
                <p>Have a consumer looking for a specific vehicle, one for their daughter, for their son, or for their husband 
                    or their wife, or a commericial customer wanting to buy a van or a truck that you do not have in stock or
                    something you normally do not have on your lot. List it here so as to find if another dealer has one, that 
                    they might be willing to sell you. The impoortant thing for a dealer is to retain their customer base and 
                    not have customers going out and searching for a vehicle on their own. You retain control!

                <h2>ALLOWS DEALERS TO LIST USED VEHICLES FOR TRADE TO OTHER DEALERS!</h2>
                <h3>$49 Listing Fee</h3>
                <p>Instead of sending a vehicle to the auction you can list vehicles here for trade or sale to other dealers.
                    Vehicles might include over-age inventory, off-make trades that might not fit into your inventory, 
                    or specialty commercial vehicles RVs. The fee charged allows you to list one vehicle on the site at a 
                    time, however you can change that listing to show different vehicles as often as you want.  Should a
                    dealer want to show two vehicles on the site, at a time, the fee is $89.

                <h3>Check with other dealers as to what they think a vehicle is worth!</h3>
                <p>Perhaps you are looking at a vehicle you are not familiar with. Maybe you could list the vehicle on the 
                    site to find out what another dealer, who deals with that make or type of vehicle would pay for it. If it
                    is a trade and the vehicle the customer wants to trade is a BMW or a Mercedes or an Audi convertible
                    and you're a Kia or a Ford franchise. List it on the site to find out if what you might offer is too 
                    much or too litt1e? A response to your listing might normally be quite quick and the listing fee is a 
                    small amount to pay to be safe, or help you make the deal.

                <h3>What happens when a customer calls wanting you to help them find a cube van or a flat deck truck?</h3>
                <p>Do you say that you can't help them, or do you tell them to give you 24 hours and you will find out what 
                    might be out there! Then you go onto the website, and do a FREE SEARCH and a leasing company, or rental
                    company or even another dealer sees what you are looking for and responds. There is a good chance that
                    you will find what the customer is looking for, and most importantly is that you are the one who finds it
                    and not another dealer. You maintain control!

        <img class='cars george' src="images/george.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
        
        <p>I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in
          1975. This was after having completed a year of university I needed to find a job to go back to school and
          finish my degree, but being married with a family it quickly became more of a
          dream than a reality. 47 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and light
          trucks and with a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I retired – then I
          came back to school to finish my degree. Back in 1973 I studied accounting, but now that I am back I am
          studying
          Website Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great individuals I was able to design
          this
          website for the use of dealers as a part of my final project. <br>During those 47 years that I sold new
          vehicles,
          I also sold almost every other make there was, because those were what my customers, who came to see me year
          after year,
          wanted. So when customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them I had nothing like that on the lot
          I would
          say that I would check and call them back tomorrow – and then immediately I would email other dealers to find
          out if
          they could help and most often another dealer had almost exactly what I needed. Then we would figure out a
          price
          and I would phone my customer and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and usually I
          made the
          deal. <br>Such can be verified by the dealership I used to work for, but in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle
          Salesperson
          I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I purchased from other dealers. I made a lot of money doing that and the
          dealership
          I worked for did as well. <br>I am now retired, but right now this website is what I am about. I want to fill
          a gap
          that exists in our industry where automotive dealers might more effectively work with one another (instead of
          always
          going through the auction) to find vehicles they want, and especially to find a vehicle that they need right
          now.
