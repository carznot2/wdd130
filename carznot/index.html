          <p class="card-text">Have a consumer looking for a specific vehicle? Maybe even something for their
            daughter, for their son,
            or for their husband or their wife, or a commericial customer wanting to buy a van or a truck that you do
            not have in stock or
            something that you normally do not carry on your lot. List it here so as to find if another dealer has
            one, that
            they might be willing to sell you. The impoortant thing for a dealer is to retain their customer base and
            not have customers going out and searching for a vehicle on their own. You retain control!

          <h2 class="card-headline">ALLOWS DEALERS TO LIST USED VEHICLES FOR TRADE TO OTHER DEALERS!</h2>
          <h3 class="card-subheadline">$49 Listing Fee!</h3>
          <p class="card-text">Instead of sending a vehicle to the auction you can list vehicles here for trade or
            sale to other dealers.
            Vehicles might include over-age inventory, off-make trades that might not fit into your inventory,
            or specialty commercial vehicles or RVs. The fee charged is per month and allows you to list one vehicle
            on the site at a
            time, however if that vehicle is sold you can change that listing to show a different vehicle at no extra
            charge. Should a
            dealer want to show two vehicles on the site, at a time, the fee increases to $89 per month. Remember as
            well, that valuations
            can differ from one region to another. The website allows you to take advantage of those differences and
            you might get a better
            price from a dealer in another region than you might from a customer in your area.

          <h2 class="card-headline">VALUATIONS!</h2>
          <h3 class="card-subheadline">Check with other dealers as to what they think a vehicle is worth!</h3>
          <p class="card-text">Perhaps you are looking at a possible trade you are not familiar with. Maybe you could
            list the vehicle on the
            site to find out what another dealer, who deals with that make or type of vehicle would pay for it. If it
            is a trade and the vehicle the customer wants to trade is a BMW or a Mercedes or an Audi convertible
            and you're a Kia or a Ford franchise then list it on the site and find out what its worth. A response to
            your listing
            might normally be quite quick and the listing fee is a small amount to pay as compared to making a
            mistake!

          <p class="card-text">Maybe you don't normally carry these vehicles in stock. Do you say that you can't help
            them, or do you tell
            them to give you 24 hours and you will find out what might be out there! Then you go onto the website, and
            do a FREE SEARCH
            and a leasing company, or a rental company or even another dealer sees what you are looking for and
            responds. There is a good
            chance that you will find what the customer is looking for, and most importantly is that you are the one
            who finds it for them
            and not another dealer. You maintain control!

        <h2 class="headline">TESTIMONIAL</h2>

        <p>I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in 1975. After
          having completed
          a year of university I needed to find a job to go back to school and finish my degree, but being married
          with a family it quickly
          became more of a dream than a reality. 47 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and
          light trucks and with
          a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I retired – then I went back to school
          to finish my degree.
          Back in 1973 I studied accounting, but now I am back I am studying Website Design and Data Management, and
          with the encouragement of
          some great individuals including my wife and with 47 years of experience selling cars and trucks I have
          developed this website to help
          dealers sell more vehicles. </p>

        <p>During those 47 years I sold new Fords, but I also sold almost every other make of vehicle there was,
          because those were what my customers, who came to see me year
          after year, sometimes wanted. So when past customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them I had
          nothing like they wanted on the lot
          I would say that I would check and call them back – and then immediately I would email 30 or 40 other
          dealers to find
          out if they could help. </p>

        <p>Most often another dealer had almost exactly what I needed. Then together we would figure out a
          price and I would phone my customer and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and
          because availabitly
          is often more of on an issue to the customer than the price I usually made the deal. Such can be verified by
          the dealership I used
          to work for, but in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle Salesperson I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I
          purchased from other dealers.
          I made a lot of money doing that and the dealership I worked for did as well. </p>

        <p>This website is restricted and is for the use of franchised dealers only. Membership is free! Our search
          service is also free! A small fee is
          charged only when you want to list a vehicle on the site for trade, or for sale to another dealer. Work
          directly with the other dealer, instead
          of through an auction. 47 years of experience in this industry is what I offer and I know that if you use
          this site, that it will work for you.</p>
