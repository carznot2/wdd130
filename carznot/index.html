                <p class="card-text">Have a consumer looking for a specific vehicle? Maybe even something for their daughter, for their son, 
                    or for their husband or their wife, or a commericial customer wanting to buy a van or a truck that you do not have in stock or
                    something that you normally do not carry on your lot. List it here so as to find if another dealer has one, that 
                    they might be willing to sell you. The impoortant thing for a dealer is to retain their customer base and 
                    not have customers going out and searching for a vehicle on their own. You retain control!

              <h3 class="card-subheadline">$49 Listing Fee!</h3>
              <p class="card-text">Instead of sending a vehicle to the auction you can list vehicles here for trade or sale to other dealers.
                  Vehicles might include over-age inventory, off-make trades that might not fit into your inventory, 
                  or specialty commercial vehicles or RVs. The fee charged is per month and allows you to list one vehicle on the site at a 
                  time, however if that vehicle is sold you can change that listing to show a different vehicle at no extra charge.  Should a
                  dealer want to show two vehicles on the site, at a time, the fee increases to $89 per month. Remember as well, that valuations 
                  can differ from one region to another. The website allows you to take advantage of those differences and you might get a better 
                  price from a dealer in another region than you might from a customer in your area.

            <p class="card-text">Perhaps you are looking at a possible trade you are not familiar with. Maybe you could list the vehicle on the 
                site to find out what another dealer, who deals with that make or type of vehicle would pay for it. If it
                is a trade and the vehicle the customer wants to trade is a BMW or a Mercedes or an Audi convertible
                and you're a Kia or a Ford franchise then list it on the site and find out what its worth. A response to your listing
                might normally be quite quick and the listing fee is a small amount to pay as compared to making a mistake!

            <p class="card-text">Maybe you don't normally carry these vehicles in stock. Do you say that you can't help them, or do you tell 
              them to give you 24 hours and you will find out what might be out there! Then you go onto the website, and do a FREE SEARCH 
              and a leasing company, or a rental company or even another dealer sees what you are looking for and responds. There is a good 
              chance that you will find what the customer is looking for, and most importantly is that you are the one who finds it for them
              and not another dealer. You maintain control!

        <h2 class="headline">TESTIMONIAL</h2>
        
        <p>I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in 1975. After having completed 
          a year of university I needed to find a job to go back to school and finish my degree, but being married with a family it quickly 
          became more of a dream than a reality. 47 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and light trucks and with 
          a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I retired – then I went back to school to finish my degree.           
          Back in 1973 I studied accounting, but now I am back I am studying Website Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of 
          some great individuals including my wife and with 47 years of experience selling cars and trucks I have developed this website to help
          dealers sell more vehicles. </p>
          
          <p>During those 47 years I sold new Fords, but I also sold almost every other make of vehicle there was, because those were what my customers, who came to see me year
          after year, sometimes wanted. So when past customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them I had nothing like they wanted on the lot
          I would say that I would check and call them back – and then immediately I would email 30 or 40 other dealers to find
          out if they could help. </p>
          
          <p>Most often another dealer had almost exactly what I needed. Then together we would figure out a
          price and I would phone my customer and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and because availabitly 
          is often more of on an issue to the customer than the price I usually made the deal. Such can be verified by the dealership I used 
          to work for, but in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle Salesperson I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I purchased from other dealers. 
          I made a lot of money doing that and the dealership I worked for did as well. </p>
          
         <p>This website is restricted and is for the use of franchised dealers only. Membership is free! Our search service is also free! A small fee is 
         charged only when you want to list a vehicle on the site for trade, or for sale to another dealer. Work directly with the other dealer, instead
         of through an auction. 47 years of experience in this industry is what I offer and I know that if you use this site, that it will work for you.</p>
