        <img class='cars george' src="images/george.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
        
        <p>I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in
          1975. This was after having completed a year of university I needed to find a job to go back to school and
          finish my degree, but being married with a family it quickly became more of a
          dream than a reality. 47 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and light
          trucks and with a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I retired – then I
          came back to school to finish my degree. Back in 1973 I studied accounting, but now that I am back I am
          studying
          Website Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great individuals I was able to design
          this
          website for the use of dealers as a part of my final project. <br>During those 47 years that I sold new
          vehicles,
          I also sold almost every other make there was, because those were what my customers, who came to see me year
          after year,
          wanted. So when customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them I had nothing like that on the lot
          I would
          say that I would check and call them back tomorrow – and then immediately I would email other dealers to find
          out if
          they could help and most often another dealer had almost exactly what I needed. Then we would figure out a
          price
          and I would phone my customer and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and usually I
          made the
          deal. <br>Such can be verified by the dealership I used to work for, but in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle
          Salesperson
          I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I purchased from other dealers. I made a lot of money doing that and the
          dealership
          I worked for did as well. <br>I am now retired, but right now this website is what I am about. I want to fill
          a gap
          that exists in our industry where automotive dealers might more effectively work with one another (instead of
          always
          going through the auction) to find vehicles they want, and especially to find a vehicle that they need right
          now.
