                <h2>The Chilquat River!</h2>
                <h3>Near Revelstoke, British Columbia</h3>
                <p>This is what movies are made of, the wild, non-relenting Chilquat River,
                    the wildlife, the hiking trails and the camping! Every moment spent
                    is a moment you'll enjoy! Seven miles of wild water, raging currents, scenery 
                    that you will not forget and will see nowhere else. Our guides as you see 
                    here in the photo are like no others! They'll make you laugh and at times 
                    they will also make you scream, and at times you will wonder if you might 
                    survive. Enjoy the thrills and enjoy the very best there is on the Chilquat!
