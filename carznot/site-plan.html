      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This is a restricted website intended specifically for automotive dealers to help them find used vehicles by working with each other.</p>  
      <p>This is done by having dealers list vehicles on the site that they have an immediate need for, allowing other dealers to respond with inventory they are willing to sell wholesale.</p> 
      <p>It will also allow automotive dealers to post vehicles on the site that are overage, or off-make, that the dealer is willing to trade to another dealer.</p>

      <p>My name is George Shaw. I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in 1975. This was when after having completed a year of university I needed to find a job so that 
        I could go back to school and finish my degree, but being married with a family that quickly became more of a dream than a reality, and 47 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and light 
        trucks and having had a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I retired – then I came back to school, to the same university I was at when I started my degree in 1973.
        In 1973 I studied accounting, but now that I am back, and studying Website Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great individuals I have designed this website for the use of dealers as 
        a part of my final project. During those 47 years, I sold new vehicles, mostly Ford, but I also sold probably every other make there was, because they were what my customers, who came to see me year after year, wanted. 
        So instead of telling customers that I <i> ‘don’t have one’,</i> or <i> ‘let’s wait and I will call you if anything comes in’</i> or <i>'maybe there might be something like that going through the auction next week or 
        next month'</i>, I would always tell them that I would check and call them back by tomorrow – and then immediately I would email other dealers and most often somebody out there, even in another province, had the 
        exact same vehicle my customer was looking for. Then we would figure out a price and I would phone my customer and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it, and usually I made the deal. 
        Such can be verified by the dealership I used to work for, but in one year, in 2016, I personally brought in 70 used vehicles (from other sources – not vehicles from off our lot) that I then delivered to my customers 
        by using this process. I made a lot of money doing that and the dealership I worked for did as well. I am now retired, but right now this website is what I am about. I want to fill a gap that exists in our industry 
        where automotive dealers might work directly with each other (instead of going through the auction) to find vehicles they want, and especially to find a vehicle they have a customer for right now. This is the reason 
        why I have built this website. I know the business well, and I know that this will work.
