    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The website will allow automotive dealers to search for vehicles they have an immediate need for. For example when a prospective customer contacts an
    automotive dealer while searching for a specific vehicle it is most often that they want the vehicle now and are not willing to wait. This is supported by
    statistics which show that most potential customers will purchase a used vehicle within 48 hours of beginning their search. </p>  <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p><b>This is a restricted website</b>. It is intended specifically for automotive dealers. Instead of a response telling a customer that the vehicle they are
      searching for is not in stock it enables the dealer to suggest that they might be able to find a vehicle for them. The dealer can then list what they are
      looking for on the website allowing for several hundred other dealers to see their request and respond. </p>  <!-- change this -->

    <p>My name is George Shaw. I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in
      1975. This was when after having completed a year of university I needed to find a job so that
      I could go back to school and finish my degree, but being married with a family that quickly became more of a
      dream than a reality, and 47 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and light
      trucks and having had a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I retired – then I
      came back to school, to the same university I was at when I started my degree in 1973.
      In 1973 I studied accounting, but now that I am back, and studying Website Design and Data Management, and with
      the encouragement of some great individuals I have designed this website for the use of dealers as
      a part of my final project. During those 47 years, I sold new vehicles, mostly Ford, but I also sold probably
      every other make there was, because they were what my customers, who came to see me year after year, wanted.
      So instead of telling customers that I <i> ‘don’t have one’,</i> or <i> ‘let’s wait and I will call you if
        anything comes in’</i> or <i>'maybe there might be something like that going through the auction next week or
        next month'</i>, I would always tell them that I would check and call them back by tomorrow – and then
      immediately I would email other dealers and most often somebody out there, even in another province, had the
      exact same vehicle my customer was looking for. Then we would figure out a price and I would phone my customer and
      tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it, and usually I made the deal.
      Such can be verified by the dealership I used to work for, but in one year, in 2016, I personally brought in 70
      used vehicles (from other sources – not vehicles from off our lot) that I then delivered to my customers
      by using this process. I made a lot of money doing that and the dealership I worked for did as well. I am now
      retired, but right now this website is what I am about. I want to fill a gap that exists in our industry
      where automotive dealers might work directly with each other (instead of going through the auction) to find
      vehicles they want, and especially to find a vehicle they have a customer for right now. This is the reason
      why I have built this website. I know the business well, and I know that this will work.
