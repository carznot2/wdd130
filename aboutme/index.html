    <h1>It's all about me!</h1>    
    <img alt="George and Danielle" src="images/georgeanddanielle.jpg">
    <p>My name is George, and I am originally from New Zealand. The degree I am pursuing is in Website Design and Development. I am older than most other students, having turned 77 last March, so that makes me just two and a half years away from turning 80, which is really old!</p>
    <p>I spent seven years in the regular forces, in the Infantry, and spent two of those years in South East Asia during the Vietnam War, so Iâ€™m a veteran.  I suffered from severe PTSD some years ago and I am of the opinion that it changed my life for the better and gave me a greater desire to gain a better understanding of how I think and how others think, and how we interact with one another.</p>
    <p>I have spent the last 45 years working as a car salesman and I did very well in that profession, becoming at one time the top salesperson for Ford Motor Company in Canada.</p>
    <p>I have been an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since joining the Church as a convert when I was young and I have been blessed with many opportunities to serve in the church, and meet many wonderful people.  Years ago I also spent a little bit of time in the political arena which was an interesting experience.</p> 
    <p>I started my degree at BYU Provo back in 1974 when I got out of the military, but my wife and I had four children at the time and we ran out of money, so we came to Canada and I started selling cars.  I enjoy life a lot and I feel that I still have a lot to learn. It is the reason why I am taking this class and why I am coming back to BYU to finish my degree. I am not really good at understanding computers and all the jargon involved, but I want to succeed and will be doing the best I can to at least understand how coding works.  My goal or my hope at this time is to be able to comprehend all that we are taught and then continue on with other courses and then hopefully one day I can build a website that car dealers will be able to use in that ever-changing industry.  Wish me luck! I am probably going to need it!</p>
